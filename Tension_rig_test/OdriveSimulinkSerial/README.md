# OdriveSimulinkSerial
Simulink System Object for controlling Odrive using serialport object on Matlab. 
Work is in Progress...

The code is based on the work done by @aa4cc,  Where they use a Rasberry Pi to make the connection between the Odrive and Simulink ([here](https://github.com/aa4cc/SimulinkOdrive/tree/master))


# Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Add into matlab path
3. Add a system block on Simulink
4. Select the `system_odrive_serial.m`

# Others

In the Others folder there is `Test_serial_odrive.m`, where the functions are tested.
